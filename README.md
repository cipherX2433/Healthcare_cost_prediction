# Healthcare_cost_prediction

Healthcare Cost Prediction
This project provides models and tools for predicting healthcare insurance premiums based on various patient attributes and features. It leverages machine learning techniques to estimate the cost of healthcare coverage, which can help insurance companies and policyholders make informed decisions.
Project Overview
Healthcare costs are a significant concern for both individuals and insurance providers. Accurate prediction of insurance premiums can enable better financial planning and personalized healthcare insurance plans. This repository contains Jupyter notebooks and supporting files to preprocess data, train prediction models, and evaluate their performance.
Repository Structure
Healthcare_premium_pred.ipynb – Initial notebook for exploring the dataset and building baseline models.
Healthcare_premium_pred2.ipynb – Enhanced model development and feature engineering.
Healthcare_premium_pred_rest.ipynb – Additional model experiments and validation.
Healthcare_premium_pred_rest_with_gr.ipynb – Experiments including gradient boosting regression.
Healthcare_premium_pred_young.ipynb – Models focusing on younger demographics.
Healthcare_premium_pred_young_with_gr.ipynb – Gradient boosting models for young demographic data.
app/ – This folder likely contains application files or scripts to deploy the model (e.g., Flask or FastAPI).
artifacts/ – Contains saved models, encoders, or other artifacts generated by the notebooks.
Technologies Used
Python
Jupyter Notebook
Machine Learning libraries such as scikit-learn, XGBoost (based on gradient boosting references)
Data processing and analysis libraries like pandas and numpy
Model deployment frameworks (potentially Flask/FastAPI in the app folder)
How to Use
Clone the repository:
text
git clone https://github.com/cipherX2433/Healthcare_cost_prediction.git
Install dependencies (recommend creating a virtual environment):
text
pip install -r requirements.txt
(Create this file if not present, including packages like pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, xgboost, flask, etc.)
Explore the notebooks for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training.
Use the saved models from the artifacts folder for predictions or integrate them into the app for deployment.
Run the application in the app folder to serve the prediction model (instructions depend on your app setup).
Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing models is expected to include healthcare-related features such as age, gender, BMI, smoking habits, and region information. Please ensure you provide or obtain the dataset accordingly to run the notebooks.
